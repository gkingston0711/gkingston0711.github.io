code/site walk through:

Nav Bar:
At the top of the page is a nav bar. This contains each section of code that when pressed is navigated to. I used JS to
make it so when an item in the nav bar is pressed only the code for that section shows, giving my site the appearence of 
multiple pages, when in actuality its just a single page. This has the drawback of taking a few seconds to load but I feel
its worth it. I used a media query as well for the nav bar to delete the logo when the nav bar options need to stack. If 
given more time I might have tried to include my logo in the condenced nav bar. The logo also took a good amount of time
and was created using canva. 

Home page:
Home page contains pictures of myself and my life. Some appear later in other sections. I used flex box to hold all the 
photos and to make sure they fit multiple platforms I used media queries to adjust width based on screen size. 

Contace me:
This section includes a signle form to contact me. At first I had JS code to read out what was entered as an alert. However 
after adding things due to accesability issues this functionality seemed to disapear. However when submit is pressed now the
screen jumps to the home page. I believe this is because I used code to hide all the other code in each section. So submit 
essentially just refreses the page. Bringing the user back to the home screen. If given more time I would have liked to work 
on this more. However in the instructions it says functionality isnt needed for this page. 

Projects:
Inside this portion of code I have two projects being show cased. I used one of my resources to learn how to allow a dark box 
that has some opacity to appear and show what the name, description and link when the mouse is hovered over the element. I also
added the project title to the page. I went back and forth on this, as it looks better without, but is easier to understand with. 
When the screen is condenced the two elements stack, with out covering each other.

Resume:
This page is created using a flex box. I had an issue getting the text to fit on a single page with out over flowing. My solution 
was to allow for a scroll bar. This is especially noticable when the elements stack with a condenced screen. 

About me:
This page is customized using grid. As the screen shrinks or grows some elements disappear or appear based on how important I felt 
the information is. If I had more time i would of liked to figure out how to make the image more clear. I feel its fuzzy and leaves
something to be desired. I also wish I had styles the links and interest section better.
